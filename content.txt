1. Class and Objects
2. class has data/attributes and func/methods
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually.
3. Why python is called oop language?  = coz anything in python is Object(data type, data structure)
4. Advantages of OOPS concept:
    >you can create your own datatype.
    >code reusablilty
    >debugging
    >colab
5. End to End project
    >function vs method
    >magic or dunder or special method
    >self -- object itself is self 
    >you can create an attributes outside class also

    >encapsulation
    >getter and setter
    >static method

6. inheritence
    >inheritence code example
    >why inheritence is needed? (code reusablilty, parent has no access to child class)
    >what gets inherited? (constructor, non private attributes, non private methods)

    >constructor overloading(if child has its own constructor then it will not access parent's constructor), method overloading(same for methods)

    >Super keyword(used only inside class, can not access variables/attributes, used only inside child class)
    
    >type of inheritence - 1. single inheritence - normal inheritance
    2. multilevel - base class is inherited by child class, then child class is also inherited by other class(grandparent-parent-child)
    3. hierarchiel - a base class is inherited by more than one child class(parent - child1,child2)
    4. multiple <diamond problem> - a child class is inheriting from two classes(both of which are inheriting from same class), 
    5. hybrid - all type of inheritance is used
